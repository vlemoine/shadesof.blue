The color blue is an elusive one - it has a wide range, and interperatations of "blue" differs from person to person!

## Blue vs Azure vs Cyan

This site includes all hues of "blue": the classic RGB blue, as well as cyan, teal, azure, and some indigo.

There's also different concentrations of "blue" - what makes a color "grayish-blue" versus a "cool gray"? I have an idea, but I don't think it's perfect, and again, varies on who you're asking.

Blues that are deemed "gray" are marked with a half moon icon.

## What is Indigo anyway?

In my personal opinion, what we percieve as "blue" nowadays is actually indigo!

Colored pencils seem to agree with me on this one.

## Hues tracked

This site mostly tracks the hues 170 - 240.

The key word is "mostly", because there are expections with some named "blue" colors that lean green, or warmer blues (or indigo!) that still looks like blue, but has a hue value of over 240.

Blues that are deemed outside the bounds are marked with a rainbow icon.
