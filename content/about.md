title: What is Blue?

The color blue is an elusive one - it has a wide range, and interperatations of "blue" differs from person to person!

## Blue vs Cyan

This site includes color swatches perceivable as "blue" - from the classic #0000FF blue to cyan, teal, turquoise, azure, and sometimes indigo.

There are also different concentrations of "blue" - what makes a swatch greyish-blue versus a cool grey? I have an idea, but I don't think it's perfect. Once again, it varies on whom you're asking.

A swatch is deemed "grey" and marked with a half-moon icon when it meets one of the following criteria:
- Saturation is less than or equal to 22%
- Lightness is less than or equal to 10%
- Lightness is between 10-15%, and saturation is less than or equal to 5%

## What is Indigo?

In my opinion, what we perceive as "blue" nowadays is indigo!

Colored pencils seem to agree with me on this one.

## Hues Tracked

A color is "blue" when its hue is between 170 - 250 degrees.

However, there are swatches on this site that go beyond the boundary. For example, there are swatches with "blue" in the name that lean green; warmer blues (or indigo!) look blue but have a hue value of over 240.

Swatches outside the boundary have a rainbow icon.

### Hue Breakdown

A swatch is organized into one of the three color categories - Cyan, Azure, and Blue.

- Cyan is hue 180. The cyan range is 170 <= hue <= 195. Any swatch with hue value less than 170 is "beyond cyan".
- Azure is hue 210. The azure range is 195 < hue <=225.
- Blue is hue 240. The blue range is 225 < hue <= 250. Any swatch with hue value gresater than 250 is "beyond blue".
