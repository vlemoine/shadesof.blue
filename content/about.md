# What is Blue?

The color blue is an elusive one - it has a wide range, and interperatations of "blue" differs from person to person!

## Hues Tracked

This site includes color swatches perceivable as "blue" - from the classic #0000FF blue to cyan, teal, turquoise, azure, and sometimes indigo.

A color is "blue" when its hue is between 170 - 250 degrees.

However, there are swatches on this site that go beyond the boundary. For example, documented swatches with "blue" in the name look arguably green; warmer blues (or indigo!) look blue but have a hue value of over 240.

Swatches outside the boundary have a rainbow icon.

### Hue Breakdown

A swatch is organized into one of the three color categories - Cyan, Azure, and Blue.

- Cyan is hue 180. The cyan range is 170 <= hue <= 195. Any swatch with hue value less than 170 is "beyond cyan".
- Azure is hue 210. The azure range is 195 < hue <=225.
- Blue is hue 240. The blue range is 225 < hue <= 250. Any swatch with hue value gresater than 250 is "beyond blue".

## What is Indigo?

In my opinion, what we perceive as "blue" nowadays is indigo!

Colored pencils seem to agree with me on this one.

## Shades of Gray

There are also different concentrations of "blue" - what makes a swatch grayish-blue versus a cool gray? Determining "gray" is impossible because it entirely relies on context, and everyone perceives color differently. Still, I have a way to categorize a swatch as a "gray," and while it's not perfect, it (hopefully) makes a more satisfying color gradient on the homepage.

Both spelling of "grey"/"gray" does appear in the documented swatches. I try to keep it as obtained, but do add the alternative spelling as alias.

A swatch is deemed "gray" and marked with a half-moon icon when it meets one of the following criteria:
- Whiteness (W) and Blackness (B) from the HWB colorspace do not equal 0, AND
  - Saturation (S) from the HSV colorspace is less than 50% AND sum of W and B is greater than 75, OR
  - Sum of W and B is greater than or equal to 90, OR
  - Sum of W and B is greater than 80, AND
    - Difference of W and B values is 0 &pm; 3, OR
    - S is less than or equal to 33.333%
