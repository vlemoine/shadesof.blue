The color blue is an elusive one - it has a wide range, and what one may interperate as "blue" differs from person to person?

## Blue vs Azure vs Cyan

This site includes all hues of "blue," from the blue we know on the web, to cyan, and the teal and azures in between.

## What is Indigo anyway?

In my personal opinion, what our culture has deemed "blue," such as blue jeans, is actually indigo!

## Hues tracked

This site tracks the hues 180 - 240. There are some expections with some blues having a hue value of over 240, due to the fact they are closer to "blue" from a CMYK standpoint, and they subjectively look like a blue.
